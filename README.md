# Timerhax for Splatoon v2.9.0
A Python script for adjusting the timer in Splatoon in 3 different modes:

- Recon
- Battle Dojo
- Amiibo timed challenges

**Files:**

tcpgecko.py is the actual library, can use just it in IDLE (only tested on python 2)

octoling.py is a sample script to use it, to swap Inkling model with Octolings in Splatoon and edit money.

common.py is another library to make things easier to work with.

codehandler is in /codehandler, just run make
